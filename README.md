# 🤖 AI Learning Journey

Welcome to my **AI Learning Journey** repository!  
This is where I share everything I learn as I build my foundation in **Data Structures, Python, and AI/ML concepts**.

---

## 📚 About This Repository
I'm currently pursuing **BSAI (Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence)**.  
This repo is a collection of:
- 🐍 **Python practice exercises**  
- 🧠 **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** implementations  
- 🔬 My future **Machine Learning & AI projects**  

This will grow over time as I continue to learn and explore AI and software development.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** Python (primary), C++ (for some DSA)
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas (soon)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, VS Code
